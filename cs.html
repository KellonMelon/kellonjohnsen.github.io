    <h2>Computer Science Related Projects</h2>
	<h3>Minecraft Mod</h3>
		<p>Over the summer, I made a mod for Minecraft Java, called MeatBaby (the theme was not my idea). In it, I followed tutorials and made custom blocks, items, recipes, textures, and 1 entity with a custom model. </p>
		<p>It took almost 2 weeks with a lot of troubleshooting, and I will attempt to port it to a newer version in the near future. </p>
	<br>
	<h3>Networking</h3>
		<p>Over the summer, I helped my dad with his networking project, where he installed 2 access points in some buildings connected to our central router. I helped him with the software side by renaming all the access points and routers to the same SSID and changed some IP settings, and helped troubleshoot some problems. </p>
	<h3>BlackJack</h3>
    <p>I made a project that involves finding the optimal hand to stand on in a game of BlackJack. I have completed the project, but I have not verified the accuracy of the program.</p>
    <p>Because BlackJack "redefines" the Ace card, switching between 11 and 1, it makes handling odd cases tricky.</p>
	<p>Because of the nature of the program, I need to be 100% sure that every case works with a shuffled deck and a simulated game.</p>
	<p>Every draw needs to do exactly what it's supposed to and every if statement needs to work.</p>
	<p>And because of the Ace problem, it took me a while, with lots of workarounds.</p>
	<p>I used Python for this project.</p>
	<p>Video analysis of my project: <a href="https://youtu.be/cSaVm8NW1ak">VIDEO</a></p>
	<img src="pictures/probability.png" alt="Probability Chart of where to Stand in Blackjack">
	<p>Using a variable called theBigVariable, I control what limit to stand on. So the number on the graph is the highest number to "hit". Everything *above* is stood on and no more cards are drawn.</p>
	<p>Assuming the program accurately represents a game of blackjack, the program was then run 50000 times and a probability dividing wins by losses was given. It is shown on the graph above.</p>
	<p>As we can see, the simulated best hand to stand on is 14 (13 is the highest number to hit on, the one on the graph). </p>
