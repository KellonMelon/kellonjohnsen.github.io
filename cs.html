    <p>I am currently working on a project that involves finding the optimal hand to stand on in a game of BlackJack. I have completed the project, but I have not verified the accuracy of the program.</p>
    <p>Because BlackJack "redefines" the Ace card, switching between 11 and 1, it makes handling odd cases tricky.</p>
	<p>Because of the nature of the program, I need to be 100% sure that every case works with a shuffled deck and a simulated game.</p>
	<p>Every draw needs to do exactly what it's supposed to and every if statement needs to work.</p>
	<p>And because of the Ace problem, it took me a while, with lots of workarounds.</p>
	<p>I used Python for this project.</p>
	<img src="pictures/probability.jpg" alt="Probability Chart of where to Stand in Blackjack">
	<p>Using a variable called theBigVariable, I control what limit to stand on. So the number on the graph is the highest number to "hit". Everything *above* is stood on and no more cards are drawn.</p>
	<p>Assuming the program accurately represents a game of blackjack, the program was then run 50000 times and a probability dividing wins by losses was given. It is shown on the graph above.</p>
	<p>As we can see, the simulated best hand to stand on is 14 (13 is the highest number to hit on, the one on the graph). </p>
