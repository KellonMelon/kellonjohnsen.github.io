    <p>I am currently working on a project that involves finding the optimal hand to stand on in a game of BlackJack. I am almost done.</p>
    <p>Because BlackJack "redefines" the Ace card, switching between 11 and 1, it makes handling odd cases tricky.</p>
	<p>Because of the nature of the program, I need to be 100% sure that every case works with a shuffled deck and a simulated game.</p>
	<p>Every draw needs to do exactly what it's supposed to and every if statement needs to work.</p>
	<p>And because of the Ace problem, it took me a while, with lots of workarounds.</p>
	<p>I used Python for this project.</p>
